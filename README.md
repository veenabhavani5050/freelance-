import mongoose from "mongoose";
import dotenv from "dotenv";
import app from "./app.js";

dotenv.config();

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 5000;

mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI)
  .then(() => {
    console.log("MongoDB connected");
    app.listen(PORT, () => {
      console.log(`Server running on port ${PORT}`);
    });
  })
  .catch((err) => console.error("MongoDB connection failed:", err));

import contractRoutes from "./routes/contract.route.js";
import reviewRoutes from "./routes/review.route.js";
import paymentRoutes from "./routes/payment.route.js";
import notificationRoutes from "./routes/notification.route.js";

const app = express();

// Middlewares
app.use(cors({ origin: process.env.CLIENT_URL, credentials: true }));
app.use(express.json());
app.use(cookieParser());

// Routes
app.use("/api/auth", authRoutes);

});

export default app;
📦 What’s Next?
In the next step, I’ll send:

authController, userController, routes, and models for:

Registration/Login

Role-based Access
